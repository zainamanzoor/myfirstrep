I am currently unemployed so I can not afford to pay the fees of this course. Although I am an Information Technology Engineer with more than two years of experience in application support, I have  a career gap. And I want to restart my career in the field of data science and analytics. Whenever I google or whenever I browse linkedin, I find people celebrating their promotions after taking this certification course in coursera. I believe completing this course will help me in kickstarting my career again and make me rich enough to pay for such courses in the future, so that I do not need to apply for financial aid again, hopefully. But right now, as someone who has been recently divorced with no financial assets of her own, I really need this aid.My parents have already helped me a lot in life and I do not want to burden them further after all these years.

Also, this is among the top Data Science Certification courses right now on Google. 
I have already completed the What is Data Science Course and I think its beautifully explained. I am sure the remaining courses in this certification Course will help enhance my understanding of data science. I am currently unemployed so I am desperately seeking ways to enhance my knowledge and improve my resume for better chances of landing a job in the COVID affected Market.

IBM has done a great job in putting up this certification course together and I am so grateful I came across it.
